## Program 2: Web Application

### Description
A Flask web application that provides a user-friendly interface to create mashups. Users submit a form and receive the result via email as a zip file.

### Setup

#### 1. Configure Email

Open `app.py` and update the email credentials:

```python
sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"  # Your Gmail address
sender_password = "your_app_password"  # Gmail App Password
```

**Important:** Use a Gmail App Password, not your regular password.

**How to get Gmail App Password:**
1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Select "Security" in the left menu
3. Enable "2-Step Verification" if not already enabled
4. Go back to Security → App passwords
5. Select "Mail" and "Windows Computer" (or your device)
6. Copy the generated 16-character password
7. Paste it in the code as `sender_password`

#### 2. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start at `http://localhost:5000`

### Features

  "message": "Mashup creation started. You will receive an email at user@example.com when ready.",
  "jobId": "1234567890"
}
```

**Response (Error - 400):**
```json
{
  "success": false,

## Performance Notes

- **Download Time:** ~2-5 minutes for 20 videos (depends on internet)
- **Conversion Time:** ~5-10 minutes for 20 videos
- **Total Time:** 10-20 minutes for typical mashup

### Optimization Tips

- Use fewer videos for faster results (minimum 11)
- Use shorter durations (minimum 21 seconds)
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Run on a machine with SSD for faster file I/O

## Security Considerations

- Email validation prevents spam submissions
- CORS headers can be added for production
- Rate limiting recommended for production deployment
- File size limits in place (500MB)
- Input sanitization implemented

---

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Job queue system for handling multiple requests
- Email notifications for job status
- Support for different audio formats
- Playlist support
- UI progress indicator with real-time updates
- Download option instead of email
- Custom audio effects
- Batch processing
